# The-Discovery-of-Handwashing
We analyze the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine: handwashing.

### Project Description
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovered handwashing. Contaminated hands were a major cause of childbed fever, and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
